"Subspace similarity between different r.
Given Ar=8 and Ar=64 which are the learned adapta-"
"tion matrices with rank r = 8 and 64 using the same pre-trained model, we perform singular value"
decomposition and obtain the right-singular unitary matrices UAr=8 and UAr=64.7 We hope to an-

sure this quantity with a normalized subspace similarity based on the Grassmann distance (See Ap-

See Figure 3 for how φ changes as we vary i and j. We only look at

the conclusion holds for other
layers as well, as shown"
in Section H.1.
